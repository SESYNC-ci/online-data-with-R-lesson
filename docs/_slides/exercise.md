## Exercises

### Exercise 1

Identify the name of the census variable in the table of ACS variables whose
label includes "COUNT OF THE POPULATION". Next, use the Census API to collect
the data for this variable, for every county in Maryland (FIPS code 24) 
into a data frame. *Bonus*: Create a visualization of your choice.

### Exercise 2

Request an [API key for data.gov], which will enable you to access the FoodData
Central API. Use the API to collect 3 "pages" of food results matching a search 
term of your choice. Save the names of the foods and a nutrient value of your
choice into a new SQLite file.
