## Takeaway

- Web scraping is hard and unreliable, but sometimes there is no other option.
  
- Web services are the most common resource.

- Search [PyPI](https://pypi.org) for an API you plan to use.

Web services do not always have great documentation &mdash; what parameters are
acceptable or necessary may not be clear. Some may even be poorly documented on
purpose if the API wasn't designed for public use! Even if you plan to acquire
data using the "raw" web service, try a search for a relevant package on Python.
The package documentation could help.
